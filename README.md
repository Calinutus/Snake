🐍 C++ Console Snake Game

A classic Snake Game implemented in C++ and played entirely in the console (terminal).
This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, real-time input handling, and game logic implementation.

📌 About the Project

This is a simple terminal-based version of the classic Snake game where:

The snake moves continuously around the board

The player controls the direction

The snake grows when it eats food

The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself

The project focuses on strengthening foundational C++ skills and understanding game loop mechanics.
